# Work in Progress

# What is this

The Twitch Developer Rig is great.

But the Twitch Developer Rig might not get updated in time for the upcoming Kraken/v5 shutdown. This app serves to replace the Rig in a Helix only world.

## orly?

Yeah, basically it's just a "save my Extension configs" Insomnia-esque Rest Client.

# Insomnie?

Insomnia is a Rest client. I have written a Plugin for Insomnia to aid with JWT generating inside Insomnia itself. You can find that [here on Github](https://github.com/BarryCarlyon/insomnia-plugin-twitch-extension-barrycarlyon)
