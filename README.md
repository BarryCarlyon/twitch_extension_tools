# What is this

The Twitch Developer Rig is great.

But the Twitch Developer Rig might not get updated in time for the upcoming Kraken/v5 shutdown. This app serves to replace the Rig in a Helix only world.

## Installation

This is an Electron App, so it maybe installed from GitHub.
It should also update from GitHub as new versions are released on GitHub. (Needs testing as I've never done Electron updates via GitHub)

It is Code Signed with the publusher `Barry Carlyon`

## orly?

Yeah, basically it's just a "save my Extension configs" Insomnia-esque Rest Client. That wraps the main Extension functions in a handy Application.

# Insomnia?

[Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) is a Rest client. I have written a Plugin for Insomnia to aid with JWT generating inside Insomnia itself. You can find that [here on Github](https://github.com/BarryCarlyon/insomnia-plugin-twitch-extension-barrycarlyon)
